# Approved Design Direction — Simple Todo App

## Overview

A minimal, focused todo application with a clean and modern aesthetic.
Single-screen layout centered on task management with clear visual hierarchy.

## Design Principles

1. **Clarity** — Every element serves a purpose; no decorative noise
2. **Focus** — Content-first layout that keeps attention on the task list
3. **Calm** — Soft palette with an indigo accent that feels trustworthy and modern
4. **Responsive** — Mobile-first, single-column layout that works at any width

## Visual Direction

- Clean white cards on a subtle off-white background
- Indigo primary accent for actions and focus states
- Green for completed-task indicators
- Red for destructive actions (delete)
- Inter typeface for excellent readability at all sizes
- Generous spacing and rounded corners for a soft, approachable feel
- Subtle shadows to establish depth hierarchy
